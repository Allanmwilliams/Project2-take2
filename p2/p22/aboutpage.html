<p>People tend to think that "About Us" pages have to sound formal to
gain credibility and trust. But most people find it easier to trust
real human beings, rather than a description that sounds like it came
from an automaton. Trying to sound too professional on your "About Us"
page results in stiff, “safe” copy and design -- the perfect way to
make sure your company blends in with the masses.</p>

<p>The main objective of my site is to give users a chance to afford
the most expensive items they want. Many people cannot afford a 800$
pair of yeezeys so I in turn help them out by buying for full price
and selling for a cheaper price.</p>
